Law 5 — The Referee
- The referee enforces the Laws, manages time, and may apply advantage.

Law 10 — Determining the Outcome of a Match
- A goal is scored when the whole of the ball passes over the goal line, between the goalposts and under the crossbar.

Law 11 — Offside
- A player is in an offside position if any part of the head, body or feet is nearer to the opponents’ goal line than both the ball and the second-last opponent, and in the opponents’ half.
- Offside offence: a player in offside position becomes involved in active play (interfering with play, interfering with an opponent, or gaining an advantage).
- No offside offence directly from a goal kick, throw-in, or corner kick.

Law 12 — Fouls and Misconduct
- Direct free kick offences include kicking, tripping, charging, striking, pushing, and holding an opponent, as well as careless, reckless or excessive-force challenges.
- Handball: it is an offence if a player deliberately handles the ball, or when the arm makes the body unnaturally bigger (e.g., arm above shoulder level without justification).
- Cautions (yellow card): unsporting behavior, dissent, persistent offences, delaying restart, failing to respect distance, entering/re-entering without permission.
- Sending-off (red card): serious foul play, violent conduct, spitting, denying an obvious goal-scoring opportunity (handball or foul), using offensive/insulting/abusive language, second yellow card.

Law 13 — Free Kicks
- Free kicks are direct or indirect; opponents must be at least 10 yards (9.15 m) from the ball until it is in play.
- The ball is in play when it is kicked and clearly moves.

Law 14 — The Penalty Kick

- The ball is placed on the penalty mark; all players except the kicker and goalkeeper must be outside the penalty area and at least 10 yards (9.15 m) from the ball.
- The goalkeeper must be on the goal line facing the kicker until the ball is kicked.

Law 15 — The Throw-In
- The ball is thrown from the point it left the field, using both hands, delivered from behind and over the head, with both feet on or behind the touchline.
- The ball is in play when it enters the field; opponents must not unfairly distract or impede the thrower.

Law 16 — The Goal Kick
- The ball is placed anywhere in the goal area; opponents remain outside the penalty area until the ball is in play.

Restart Principles
